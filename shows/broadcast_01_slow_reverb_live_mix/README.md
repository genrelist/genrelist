## Info
Party tricks' first live mix, recorded live on 04-11-2023. 

A few months prior to this recording I was spending a lot of time listening to slowed/reverbed versions of songs on youtube.

It's interesting what simply changing a song's key and adding effects can yield -- the song sounds familiar but takes on new characteristics. Vocals morph, taking on new tones and attitudes, and percussion captures your train of thought in a totally different way. 

Nearly any moderately-known song you can think of has already been mixed in this way and uploaded to youtube. I found that I enjoyed the effect on pop songs the most.

This is a collection of some of the songs that I thought worked well, slowed and mixed live on index radio.
